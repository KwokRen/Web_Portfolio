### Description

***

Kwok Ren's Portfolio Website is a website that is made to demonstrate the skills I've learned throughout my time as a Software Engineer. During the course of my software engineering career, I plan on updating the website with new projects. This website is also created with the intention of showing potential employers my skillset and who I am. Technologies and programming languages used for this website include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

### Inspiration

Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | Initial Research On That Item
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [http://www.pavelhuza.com/](http://www.pavelhuza.com/)| I love the website in general, it has a very welcoming feel. The logo looks crisp and clean. The navigation bar matches with the banner background and turns white at an intersection. Words fade in and out based on where you are at the page, creating a dynamic feeling. Projects are the main display of the page. | One thing I would love to incorporate in my website is to have dynamic fade in and fade out transitions based on where the user is on the page. I would also like put emphasis on projects.  |
